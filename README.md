### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a young professional transitioning from mechanical engineering to a career in data science and machine learning. As much as I love machining and building in the world of atoms, I am just as passionate about analyzing and modeling in the world of bits. With the abundance of data in our modern world, the possibilities for discovery are endless. I am looking to join a data-driven company with a strong mission and opportunities to apply all that I have learned about data science and statistics.

My technical skills include programming with Python & SQL, analyzing large datasets, building data pipelines, tuning ML models, and more. A more comprehensive list can be found on LinkedIn (link in bio). Feel free to contact me via email at abdel.balla@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
